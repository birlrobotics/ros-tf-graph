#	This file is read by ros_tf_graph/tf_broadcaster in order to determine
#	which transforms should be added to the tf tree. It does so by 
#	calling the serivce advertised by ros_tf_graph/tf_finder, which actively 
#	looks for a path between coordinate frames in order to connect them.
#
#	The syntax is as follows:
#
#	# denotes a comment line
#
#	1st column: src_frame (where measurements are generated, child_id)
#	2nd column: dest_frame (where measurements should be converted to, frame_id)
